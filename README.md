## Regex matching web app

The task is to replicate the core functionality of the website regex101.com. This entails creating a web application that allows users to input a test string and a regular expression (regex) and displays all the matches found. And to check the given Email id is valid or not.

### Technologies used:

* Flask: Flask is a lightweight web application framework for Python. It allows you to build web applications quickly and efficiently. You’ll use Flask to handle routing, request handling, and response rendering.
* HTML/CSS: You’ll need HTML for creating the structure of your web pages and CSS for styling them. These technologies work together to create a user-friendly interface.
* Regular Expressions (Regex): Since our app is all about regex matching, you’ll use Python’s built-in re module to perform pattern matching and validation.
